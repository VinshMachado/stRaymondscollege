        St. Raymond’s Pre-University College, established in the year 2001,
        stands today as a beacon of educational excellence and community
        commitment. The foundation of this institution was laid in response to
        the aspirations and needs of the local community, who desired a center
        of quality education for their youth. Rising to this call, Rev. Sr.
        Inviolatha BS, Provincial Superior together with Sr. Cicilia Mendonca

        region’s most respected institutions.

        significant emphasis on co-curricular development, nurturing students
        into well-rounded individuals.
